<p><strong>AWS SQS Integration</strong></p>
<p>Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. Using SQS, enterprises can send, store, and receive messages between software components.</p>
<p>The Stonebranch Universal Tasks for AWS SQS allows you to create, send and monitor AWS SQS messages and automatically trigger a task or workflow in Universal Controller each time a message has been received.</p>
